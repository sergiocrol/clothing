## What is this app

Clothing App is a personal project where I wanted to put in practice my React knowledges, but using redux as state management library. Also, I implemented several other libs, as styled-components for CSS, Firebase for storage and authentication (integrating Google Auth), as well as topics like PWA, lazy loading, or handle the payments with Stripe.
